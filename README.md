## About Me

A tester with grand  background in crowdtesting platforms.

Consider self-development as the main priority in my life!

I have been involved in testing as a football referee, I got the 1st category (7 years of experience). This activity requires attention to detail, strict adherence to requirements, the ability to make quick decisions under pressure, concentration and the ability to remain objective regardless of circumstances.
